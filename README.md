Learning the art of *web development* involves learning, at least, 3 different languages:-  

1. HTML/HyperText MarkUp Language (used to add underlying structure to the web page/as well as, semantic content)    
2. CSS/Cascading Style Sheet Code (used to add 'decorative' effects to the web page, including: colours/fonts/sizes/positioning/-etc.)   
3. JS/Javascript (used to add 'interactivity' to web pages)  

This repository is mostly concerned with showing off HTML codes.
